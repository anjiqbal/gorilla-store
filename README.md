###### May 2023

A React app that pulls dummy data from Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/), allows you to search for specific items and displays it in a responsive way.

## Motivation

This week's hackathon task was a way of consolidating evrything we have learnt so far. It was built in React, fetched data from an API, filtered that data given a search term and displayed everything in a responsive way. I continued to work on this project following the team work on Friday.

## Lessons Learned

- Filtering the data using a search term - this was the first time I had done this and I found my initial approach did not work. I changed my approach and after some playing around with states and adding another useEffect, I was able to make it work.
- Use of CSSGrid and Flexbox to make a responsive page - this was an area I needed more practice in and will still need to practice.
- Using Material UI - This was again the first time I had done this. With the help of a colleague, I was able to understand how to use components from a front end library. Also understanding when it is better to not use a library as they can be very bloated.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Improvements

Potential future improvements:

- Add sort functionality
- Add routes so that when an item is clicked on it takes you to another page with more detail
- Add the ability to add to shopping cart and then view the contents of the shopping cart
